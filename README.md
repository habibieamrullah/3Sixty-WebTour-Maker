# 360WebTourMaker
Free Web Panorama Tour Maker Software

This software is built with Electron, using awesome JavaScript libraries such as Panolens, Three.js and the legendary jQuery.

It is open source and free, it will always be.

What you see in this repository are only my main app HTML, JavaScript and css files. 

There is a folder generated by Electron which is node_modules which I did not include here because its size is too big. 

Important modules that I used are: fs, fs-extra and remote. You need to install those modules:

npm install --save fs
npm install --save fs-extra
npm install --save remote
